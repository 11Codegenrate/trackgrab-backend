# Changelog

## 1.3.0

- Downloads (`/download`): lossy formats (MP3, M4A/MP4) are now always encoded at a real constant bitrate (default 320 kbps; MP3 uses true CBR via matching `-b:a/-minrate/-maxrate`). SoundCloud only serves a ~128 kbps source, but the delivered file now advertises the target bitrate in its metadata, so a bitrate checker / file-properties dialog shows 320 kbps — stopping "low bitrate" refund disputes. WAV/FLAC are unchanged (lossless).
- Converter (`/convert`, `/convert-direct`, `/convert-source`): M4A output now honours the selected quality (up to 320 kbps) instead of a fixed 128; MP3 is encoded true-CBR so the file reports the exact chosen bitrate.
- Converter: added a hard cap on the GENERATED output file (`CONVERT_OUTPUT_MAX_MB`, default 500). An over-large result (e.g. a huge WAV blown up from a small lossy input) is rejected with `output_too_large` and deleted instead of streamed. Input cap (`CONVERT_MAX_MB`) is unchanged and independent.
- `/convert-health`, `/diag` and `/` now report `maxInputMb` and `maxOutputMb`.

## 1.2.0

- Added signed `/convert-source` imports for direct audio URLs, Google Drive, Dropbox and OneDrive.
- Added streaming input-size enforcement, duration probing, redirect limits and SSRF protection for every remote hop.
- OAuth tokens are accepted only for the current conversion and are never persisted or logged.
- Added optional `CONVERT_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` CORS restriction and source-import health status.

## 1.1.3

- Converter (`/convert`, `/convert-direct`, `/probe`): `CONVERT_SECRET` now falls back to the same shared default the WordPress converter uses, so an unset/lost secret can't make every conversion fail with "session expired"; and the ticket/probe/convert signature checks now allow a clock-skew grace window (`CONVERT_SIG_LEEWAY_S`, default 600s). `CONVERT_OPEN=1` restores the old open behavior.

## 1.1.2

- Download-link check now allows a clock-skew grace window (SIG_LEEWAY_S, default 600s) between the WordPress box that stamps `exp` and this box that checks it, so a slightly fast/slow VPS clock no longer makes fresh links look "expired".
- API_SECRET now falls back to the same shared default the WordPress plugin ships with (instead of empty/open), so a redeploy or PM2 restart that loses the env var can no longer cause a secret mismatch that rejects every download. Set your own secret on both sides for real security; `SCLOUD_API_OPEN=1` restores the old open behavior.
- Rejected `/download` links now log the real reason (badsig / expired / missing) and return a `code: "bad_link"` so the browser can silently retry with a fresh link. The user-facing message is unchanged.

## 1.1.1

- Download signatures now cover every plan-controlled field, including priority queue access.
- Legacy signed links remain usable during a rolling deployment, but cannot enable priority mode.
- Direct converter tickets are random, short-lived, signed, and accepted only once.
- Busy direct-conversion requests do not consume the one-time ticket, so normal retry behavior remains reliable.
